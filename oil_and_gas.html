       <h2><b>Oil trading with CFD</b></h2>
       <p>Surprising as it might be, anyone can invest in the oil market to make a profit. Indeed, 
        the development of online trading platforms has allowed individuals to use their savings to speculate on rising or falling oil prices.
         To this end, simply choose your method of trading between the CFDs offered by Forex brokers, which are specifically designed for beginners. 
        Invest-oil.co.uk makes a point to explain how these two trading tools work and how best to use them for profit.</p>
        <h2><b>CFDs for investing in oil:</b></h2>
        <p>At the present time CFDs are undoubtedly the most appropriate tools for investing your money in the oil price. They are in fact 
          ‘Contracts for the Difference’ that are available online through broker trading platforms and enable individuals to speculate on the price per 
          barrel of WTI or Brent crude oil from a secure area online. More precisely, CFDs enable you to take position in just a few clicks,
           on buying and selling positions on the crude oil stock markets. You can thereby speculate on the rise or fall of the oil price and close your
            positions when the price per barrel has attained the price objective that you fixed. Your profit will correspond here to the price difference 
            between the opening time and closing times of your position in proportion to the amount invested and if the price has moved in the direction you 
            forecast. In the case to the contrary your loss will also represent this price difference. CFDs offer numerous advantages including the fact
             that they are very easy to use, even for individuals that are not used to investing alone on the financial markets. Another thing, they offer a 
             leverage effect that enables an increase in the amount of your profits even with a small difference in rate. Of course, you also have a wide range of tools available such as orders that enable you to effectively manage your positions and reduce your risks. You will of course find lots of information about oil trading using CFDs on our website which also offers advice on how to best use these trading instruments. 
          In this way you can start to use them when investing your capital in oil without having to go through an intermediary.</p>
      </section>
        <section class="writtings_section_2">
         <h2>Benefits of investing in oil:</h2>
         <p>Traded oil has many advantages compared to other popular assets such as for example stocks. Speculating with oil only requires some basic 
          technical and fundamental analysis of the market. Terms seem complicated? Not to worry! The website invest-oil.co.uk was specifically created to 
          assist investors in understanding the rules of investing in black gold and thereby enable
           them to easily gain access to this opportunity. You will have the upper hand to quickly make profits and earn money simply through oil price 
           changes.</p>
           <h2>The best investment strategies for oil:</h2>
           <p>On our website you will also find strategic advice to help you succeed in your investments on the oil price. Depending on your wishes and your 
            level of knowledge, there are several different ways of investing your money in black gold. For example, long term trading is more appropriate for
            those with a large investment capital who wish to accumulate profits in the future without the need to withdraw profits rapidly. Those investors who wish, 
            on the contrary, to make profits rapidly, even daily, on oil may find other investment methods that suit them better. To assist you in creating your strategies we
             notably recommend certain analysis techniques as well as the best fundamental and chart indicators that you can find on your broker’s platform which will assist you
              in your analysis of the oil rate. We will also explain which are the best times to take positions on crude oil and how to use the news and current events to predict a 
              significant rise or fall in the price of black gold and keep an eye on the charts available through your online trading platform. We will also reveal some tips that will 
              enable you to make greater profits and reduce your risks such as, for example, using social trading or automatic trading which are just two of the many functions available through CFD brokers.
               The different strategies and techniques presented on this website are suitable for all investors with some strategies particularly appropriate for beginners and others more suited to experienced investors. 
              Depending on your level of knowledge you should start investing using the method that best corresponds to you and thereby not risk feeling lost when faced with the market and all its particularities.

         <h2>Speculating online:</h2>
         <p>Speculate online on the price of black gold on the rise or on the fall, you should rely on the advice of this site devoted to black gold trading. 
          Indeed, you will find explanations of the different factors driving prices up or down, as well as news on this explosive market. This site covers 
          all the basics of this market and speculation techniques, explained in a simple and illustrated manner for better understanding.
           The only thing left to do will be...to implement your strategy.</p>
           <h2>Know the oil market well to improve investment:</h2>
           <p>The oil market is both simple and complex. The fact of trading on a single asset is in itself an advantage, notably for inexperienced 
            investors, especially as oil is a relatively simple asset to analyse with a large amount of information available for your scrutiny. 
            However the different actors in this market also exert a concrete and direct influence on the price of this commodity and it is of course 
            absolutely necessary to know them well and understand the global operation of this market before starting to invest your capital. With the 
            different articles available on our website you can learn everything you need to know about the oil market and how to become a real expert 
            in this subject. For example, you will learn how this market is organised with details on the major oil producers, consumers and exporters 
            throughout the world as well as how the price per barrel of oil is calculated. We will also explain how the geopolitical news and events or
             other exterior events can exert an influence on the rise or fall in the oil price per barrel. The factors that influence the price of
              black gold are actually quite well known and fairly easy to identify. Using some basic indicators such as the American dollar rate or the
               oil stocks in the United States it is possible to anticipate a rise or fall in the oil price. Once you have understood all this 
              information that is explained to you clearly and in a straightforward manner you will surely be able to anticipate the variations in the 
              oil price. Then all you have to do is simply fine tune your trading strategies and speculate in real time on the price per barrel of 
              crude oil.

   <nav class="second_writting_mother">
       <p>
    As an individual, the best method available for trading in oil is through the use of an online trading platform that specialises in CFDs.
     You will find this service widely available among brokers that enable you, through the use of CFDs, to speculate on oil and other assets such as
      shares and stock market indices or other commodities such as gold. The operation of CFDs could not be simpler and more convenient for the use of
       anyone that wishes to invest in the oil market without having any previous experience in trading. It simply requires that you take a position on the 
    rise or the fall of the oil price at a given moment and close your position when the foreseen profits are reached or when you wish to cut your losses.
   </p>
   <h1>Let us take a simple example:</h1>
   <p>The actual price of a barrel of WTI is 106 dollars and you foresee a rise in this price due to a decrease in the American oil stocks.
     You therefore subscribe to a CFD on the rise. If the price per barrel does rise you can place an order or manually close your position and you 
     will make a profit equivalent to the difference between your subscription price and the closing price. If, to the contrary,
     the price falls you will lose the difference between the subscription price and the closing price, unless you have speculated on the price falling.</p>
     <h1>How to choose your trading platform:</h1>
     <p>As you will surely notice, the online trading platforms that offer the opportunity to speculate on the oil price are numerous. 
      It is therefore necessary that you take the time to carefully compare them in order to choose the one that offers you the most advantages.
      You therefore need to verify certain important
       points such as: The spreads practised. The possible leverage effects. The tools and indicators available. The quality and simplicity of the platform</p>
       <h1>Oil: An asset with a future</h1>
       <p>The first thing we should confirm regarding oil is that this asset will always be popular for trading and always in demand. In fact,
         oil is still the most used fossil fuel throughout the world and plays a primary role as a commodity in the fabrication of numerous industrial
          products. Due to the development of numerous countries that have consumed little oil up to now, the demand has therefore risen enormously,
           but also because of the exhaustible nature of this energy, it seems logical that the supply will lessen in the future whereas the demand 
           will continue to grow. Although this statement is slightly mitigated due to the development of renewable forms of energy, the latter are
            still far from being able to take the stage alongside oil as a major energy source and therefore 
        oil still looks to have many good years ahead as an investment. Investing in oil over the long term is therefore considered as a secure placement</p>
        <h1>Profit from the fall in the price to invest in oil over the long term:</h1>
        <p>You have no doubt noticed that, since 2014, the oil prices have fallen greatly. After approaching $100 per barrel they finally lost nearly 50% 
          of their value. But, as with all financial markets, the oil market is governed by cycles alternating between rising and falling trends. Therefore,
           the analysts predict a new rising trend shortly that may enable investors to achieve substantial profits. It is therefore
           judicious to closely monitor the emergence of this new trend to take position over the long term, or take position now using a short term cover</p>
           <h1>How to cover a long term investment in oil?</h1>
           <p>As we have just seen, the oil sector analysts expect a new rise in the price per barrel of oil in the coming months or years.
             It may therefore be beneficial to invest in oil over the long term. But, while waiting for this trend to begin, the price per barrel may still 
             experience a further fall. To cover any eventual losses during this period, you may opt for a strategy that aims to take short parallel positions 
            to sell with a strong leverage effect of which the profits enable you to keep your long position open until the rising objective is reached.</p>
            <h1>The indicators to take into account for oil trading:</h1>
            <p>To trade in oil online using CFDs it is strongly recommended to use data from both technical and fundamental analysis. Your technical analysis can
               be completed using comprehensive customised charts that are available through your broker on the trading platform upon which you can display
                different indicators. Concerning fundamental analysis, this consists of monitoring and analysing the factors and exterior events that may 
                influence the oil price. These of course include data on the supply and demand of oil throughout the world as well as other indicators. For 
                example, the American oil stocks are carefully monitored by traders. You will find them each week in the economic calendar as they are published
                 every Wednesday. These stocks give you concrete information on the demand and consumer levels of oil. Large stocks have a tendency to lower the
                  price of oil and vice versa. Finally, the U.S. Dollar rate
               can also influence the oil price as an advantageous exchange rate can encourage buyers to invest in the commodity which is quoted in this currency.</p>
